## Features

- **Hands-on Data Cleaning Notebook**: A step‑by‑step Jupyter notebook demonstrating real‑world data preprocessing techniques. 
- **Challenge Task**: A `Challenge.md` file describing an applied data cleaning exercise for practice or homework. 
- **Reference PDF**: A PDF titled **“Data Preprocessing Masterclass — From Tabular Basics to LLM Pipelines”** summarizing concepts, workflows, and best practices.

```


## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ryan-PG/ec-18-data-preprocessing-classic-and-llms.git
   cd ec-18-data-preprocessing-classic-and-llms
   ```
   

2. **Set up a Python environment:**
   - Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended), or use **Kaggle** or **Google Colab** to run the notebook in the cloud. 

4. **Open the notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook data_cleaning_tutorial.ipynb
   ```
   or upload the notebook to **Kaggle** or **Colab** and run all cells there. 

5. **Tackle the challenge:**
   - After going through the notebook, open `Challenge.md` and attempt the challenge using the same or a new notebook. 

## Using in Kaggle, Colab, and HF Spaces

- **Kaggle**: Create a new Notebook, upload `data_cleaning_tutorial.ipynb`, attach your dataset, and run cells sequentially. 
- **Google Colab**: Open the notebook from GitHub or upload it directly; mount Google Drive if you need local files. 


## Contributing

Contributions, improvements to the notebook, or additional challenge ideas are welcome. Open an issue or submit a pull request to enhance the data cleaning workflows or add new preprocessing examples.
